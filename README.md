## About
------

It provides a seamless experience throughout the entire program. You just need to execute the `main.py` file by running the following command in your terminal at the location of this folder:
Command:
```
C:\User\app\projects\crm>py main.py
```
### From here, the major functionalities start:

1. **Automatic Database Creation**: You don't need to create or run any explicit commands to create the crm.db database. The program will automatically check for its existence. If it doesn't exist, it will create it automatically, containing all the required tables to store your data.

2. **Optimized Database Querying**: We have minimized the frequency of database hits/queries, making the application more efficient.

3. **Data Persistence**: Using Pandas and its data manipulation strategies, we have integrated a backup system for the CRM. The data will persist even if you close the program without saving or exiting it properly.

4. **Efficient Data Management**: We have efficiently managed data recovery, user experience/interactivity, and file and database handling.
